# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import math
### Step 2:
list the elements in array
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4:

import math
a=[4,2]
b=[10,6]
dist=math.sqrt(((b[0]-a[0])**2)+((b[1]-a[1])**2))
print("%.2f"%dist)

```
